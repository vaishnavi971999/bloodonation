        <h3 style="color:#22a6b3;">How blood donation helps the donor?</h3>
          <h4 style="color:#22a6b3;">Keep up Healthy Heart & Liver:</h4>
          <p>Iron plays an important role in our body, iron is an important component of hemoglobin. It helps to the red blood cells to carry oxygen from lungs to the whole body. If we don’t have enough iron in our body it will lead to some iron deficiency problems. So doctors prefer to take iron rich food. Intake of iron-rich food is not a problem, the problem is taking too much of iron-rich food. The body uses sufficient amount of iron. The remaining iron substance deposited in heart, liver, and pancreas.  Because of this heart and liver problems are coming. So, donating blood iron levels are decreased and it helps to reduce heart and liver problems.</p>

          <h4 style="color:#22a6b3;">Restoration of Blood Cells:</h4>
          <p>During a regular blood donation, we can give around 470 ml of whole blood. This occupies nearly 8 or 9 percent of the average blood volume of an adult person. Soon after the regeneration of blood process will starts. Within 24 to 48 hours lost volume will regenerate. It depends upon fluid intake. And within 8 or 9 weeks lost cells are regenerated by stem cells. This process takes place in bone marrow. With the newly generated blood cells, a person energy levels and activity goes up, your body stays healthy and work more efficiently.</p>

          <h4 style="color:#22a6b3;">Weight reduction:</h4>
          <p>By donating blood once we can burn nearly 600 calories. This weight reduction comes without any exercise or anything. It is different from daily exercises because of blood donation is not a regular activity. It is better to donate blood once per quarter year. We know that these days many are prone to heart attack due to heavyweight. Even though we can burn less amount of calories through blood donation it is better than nothing.</p>
