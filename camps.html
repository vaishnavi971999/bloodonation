            <p>Every year, three camps are put up at each of the three main branches. The tentative schedule of the camps are in the month of March, July and November. The exact schedule and other details will be announced on our website one month prior to the camp.</p>

              <p><strong>What activities happen at the camps?</strong></p>
              <p>When and why a person will need blood is the an unanswerable question. But when needed, it must be arranged for immediately. This random nature of requirement makes it necessary for blood banks to have sufficient blood of all blood groups. In cases of emergencies, one might not have time or resources to find a suitable donor. In such cases, blood banks are the go-to option. To help blood banks collect blood to cater such needs, we conduct camps.<br>The camps are conducted in collaboration with hospitals that have a blood bank. Since the last two years, we have received an overwhelming response from donors. People from different parts of our country make time to come and donate blood at these camps.<br>Apart from blood donation, we also conduct regular health check ups at our camps. Talks from well known doctors and specialists in related fields are also conducted.</p>
